**New feature I attempted to add:**

Adding photos with tasks so that they can be clearer.

**Why it is a reasonable feature to expect in a frontend project.**

Sometimes certain tasks require photos to better describe what you're aiming to do. For example, I have a task to do a probability question before class tomorrow, so I attached a picture of the problem to the task. Also we simply can use `localStorage` to store the images meaning there's no actual backend logic to it. 

**How it was supposed to work.**

You should be able to attach an image with a task, have it be a reasonable size while also maintaining all the previous features from Project 5 and the new features that had been successfully implemented (be able to add multiple to do lists, name the different to do lists you create, change the “theme” of each to do list (fonts/color)). 

**How ChatGPT failed to implement it.**

On my 1st prompt, the create list button didn't work. On my 2nd prompt, the theme customizing didn't work. On my 3rd prompt, the filtering buttons didn't work. In all of these iterations, the image uploading worked but without the other functionality it didn't mean much in the grand scheme of things. Also it's important to note that the image was so small, that it was almost insignificant since you couldn't make it out at all.
